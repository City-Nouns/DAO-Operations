# DAO Operations

## Overview

This repository serves as the central hub for managing operational tasks and coordination within our DAO. It provides a standardized workflow, task tracking system, and collaboration framework to help maintain transparency and efficiency across all DAO activities.

## Purpose

The primary purposes of this repository are:

1. **Centralized Task Management** - Track all operational tasks in one place
2. **Workflow Standardization** - Provide consistent processes for different types of tasks
3. **Team Coordination** - Enable transparent collaboration among contributors
4. **Governance Integration** - Connect operational tasks with governance processes

## Kanban Board

We use a GitHub Project board as our Kanban system to track the status of all tasks. The board is organized into the following columns:

- **To Do** - Tasks that are defined but not yet started
- **To Review** - Tasks that need technical or community review
- **Testing** - Tasks that are being tested or verified
- **Security Review** - Tasks that require security audits or reviews
- **Ready for Vote** - Tasks that are ready for governance voting
- **In Progress** - Tasks that are actively being worked on
- **Done** - Completed tasks

View the board in the "Projects" tab of this repository.

## Issue Templates

When creating a new issue, select one of the following templates based on the task type:

- **Smart Contract Development** - For tasks related to smart contract creation or modification
- **DAO Governance Task** - For governance-related proposals and processes
